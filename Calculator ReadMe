Calculator is one of the most popular projects we learn to create. Often, mistakes such as not checking whether the number in division is zero or 
whether the provided values are actually numbers are made. In the project, I used the $ symbol in JavaScript code, 
which was introduced in the ECMAScript 6 standard. This allows for easier creation of strings where variables can be 
placed without the need for additional operators. The $ symbol along with curly braces {} is used to embed variables 
inside a string. In this case, the values of the variables num1, num2, and result are dynamically inserted into the 
respective places in the string. This makes the code more readable and concise, especially when dealing with more complex strings.

example: old code: num1 + ' + ' + num2 + ' = ' + result

new one: ${num1} + ${num2} = ${result}

The use of template literals makes the code more readable and concise, especially when creating longer strings with multiple variables.
