## Overview 

### The-challenge

It was my first challenge that was performed using basics of JavaScript.
The task was to build the basic calculator. On the basis of data prompted from the user the appropriate activities are performed. The result of the current  as well as the previous mathematical activities are displayed. 
I was supposed to execute calculator using only if statements and  loops without using Math Methods (like *Math.pow()*).
