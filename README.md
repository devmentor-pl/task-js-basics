# JavaScript Calculator

## :technologist: Technologies and metodologies

This project was created to develop and improve my bacis skills in JavaScript.

To use this calculator, you have to follow the directions shown in prompt box.

First of all, you have tu choose which operation you want to perform by selecting appropriate symbol, i.e.:

- \+ (to add numbers);
- \- (to subtract numbers);
- \* (to multiply numbers);
- \\ (to divide numbers);
- \^ (to raise to a given power)

Secondly, you have to select a first and second number between 0 and 9.

After this, you will see your operations in the prompt box as history of your operations.
