**Project: JS BASICS - Calculator**

## What I Learned:

Throughout the completion of these project, I gained valuable knowledge and experience in the following areas:

- **JavaScript Basics:** Deepened understanding of fundamental JavaScript concepts, including functions, conditional statements, loops, and object-oriented programming.

- **Code Refactoring:** Improved code structure and readability through refactoring techniques, such as simplifying switch statements and reducing redundant code.

- **Dynamic Operation Handling:** Learned to handle dynamic operations using objects and methods, providing a more scalable and maintainable solution.

- **Advanced JavaScript Functions:** Explored advanced functions related to arithmetic operations, loops, conditional statements, and array manipulations.

- **Refactoring and Code Optimization:** Practiced code refactoring techniques to improve code quality, readability, and efficiency.

- **Error Handling:** Implemented error handling strategies, such as preventing division by zero and checking for counter values to avoid potential issues.

## Solutions Implemented:

- **Calculator Operations:** Added various mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation) to the calculator.

- **Switch Statement Refactoring:** Refactored the switch statement for dynamic operation selection, reducing redundancy and improving code clarity.

- **Input Validation:** Enhanced input validation by using the `Number()` function, ensuring entered values are valid numbers.

- **Loop Termination:** Implemented a loop termination condition when the user enters a specific word, allowing a clean exit from the calculator.

- **Arithmetic Operations:** Added functions for arithmetic operations, multiplication tables, exponentiation, and summing the two largest numbers from three parameters.

- **Array Manipulation:** Created functions to generate random numbers, retrieve the largest numbers from an array, and calculate the average of an array.

- **Student Grade Management:** Added a method to the `Student` constructor for managing grades and calculating the average grade for a specific subject or all subjects.

## Key Considerations:

During the projects, I identified several key aspects to pay attention to:

1. **Validation in Dynamic Operations:** Ensure that the input validation logic is consistent and effective for all dynamic operations.

2. **Code Scalability:** Consider the scalability of the code, especially in handling additional operations. Explore alternative approaches for dynamic operation selection.

3. **Refactor Prompt Content Handling:** The handling of prompt content could be refactored for improved code readability and maintainability.

4. **Variable and Function Naming:** Ensure consistent use of English variable and function names for better code readability.

5. **Error Handling:** Double-check error handling mechanisms to avoid potential issues, especially when dealing with division and counter values.

6. **Code Reusability:** Explore opportunities for code reusability, such as creating a common method for repetitive code segments.
