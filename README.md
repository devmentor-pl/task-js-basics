# Project 03 - Calculator 

See the live version of [Calculator project](https://code-mike-code.github.io/task-js-basics/).

Project made during learning process with my mentor program [devmentor.pl](https://devmentor.pl/). The project is a simple calculator implemented in JavaScript, which allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. The calculator also keeps a history of all operations performed, which can be displayed to the user. The program prompts the user for input, validates the operations, and handles errors such as division by zero or invalid inputs. The main functionalities include performing calculations, storing operation history, and providing user feedback.


# Refactoring
During the refactoring process, the code was optimized to improve readability and reduce redundancy. 
The main changes included:

Replacing multiple if-else statements with a dictionary (operations): This allowed for a more concise and maintainable way to map operations to their corresponding methods.

Binding methods to the Calculator instance: This ensured that the correct context (this) was maintained when calling the methods from the operations dictionary.

Simplifying the user input validation: The code now directly checks if the action is valid and if the inputs are numbers, reducing the complexity of the logic.

## 💭 Conclusions for future projects

The refactoring made the code more modular and easier to extend. In the future, additional operations could be added by simply extending the operations dictionary and adding corresponding methods to the Calculator class. Furthermore, the code could be further improved by adding more robust error handling and possibly a user interface for a better user experience.
