# JavaScript Calculator

## Project assumptions

The task was to add the necessary elements to the existing code that will allow you to perform calculations and store the history of operations.
The calculator has the following options:

* addition (+)
* subtraction (-)
* multiplication (*)
* division (/)
* exponentiation (^) 

## The way it works

The calculator works by using a prompt box. At first, you have to choose an operation you would like to perform, and then type in a finite number.

## Description of the process

The project was built with JavaScript. Thanks to it I practiced the usage of conditional instructions, loops, functions, constructors and prototypes, objects and arrays. The biggest challenge was refactoring the project. In that process the advice from my Mentor Mateusz Bogolubow [https://devmentor.pl/] was a great help for me.
