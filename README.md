# JavaScript Calculator
&nbsp;
🧑‍💻 
This project was created to develop and improve my basics skills in JavaScript.

To use this calculator, you have to follow the directions shown in prompt box.
(./calculator.png)
First of all, you have tu choose which operation you want to perform by selecting appropriate symbol, i.e.:

&nbsp;
+ (to add numbers);
- (to subtract numbers);
* (to multiply numbers);
\ (to divide numbers);
^ (to raise to a given power)
&nbsp;

Secondly, you have to select a first and second number between 0 and 9.



After this, you will see your operations in the prompt box as history of your operations.
